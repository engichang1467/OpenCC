GLSL (Graphics Library Shader Language) Basics

attribute - incoming vertex data
varying - interpolatable varying properties passed along to next process
uniforms - properties typically shared by all vertices

vec2 - a two dimensional vector
vec3 - a three dimensional vector
vec4 - a four dimensional vector (ex. a homogenized vec3)

mat2 - a 2x2 matrix
mat3 - a 3x3 matrix
mat4 - a 4x4 matrix

void main(void){} - required function of a shader
gl_Position - required final calculated vertex position
gl_fragColor - required final calculated pixel color
