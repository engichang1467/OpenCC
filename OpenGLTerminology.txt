A Pixel is an area unit of color
    Every Pixel has a red, green, blue, and alpha component (or 4 floating-point values) 

A Vertex is a set of attributes.
    At the least, a vertex is a coordinate position in space.
    Ex. 2D will have a X and Y coordinate
        3D will have an X, Y , and Z coordinate

A Frame is a Frame of Animation
    With GLFW Library, our code will typically run at about 60 frames/second
    Each frame we execute a draw loop (or main loop)

A Framebuffer is an array of pixels. 
    This is the image that you actually see on your screen
    There are 2 Framebuffers: the front and the back
    We swap these buffers every frame of animation, so the new buffer you see is the last one to be written to
    Filling these buffers is called rendering

OpenGL specifies its own datatypes
    ex. GLubyte, GLuint, GLfloat, etc.
    GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, GL_FLOAT.
